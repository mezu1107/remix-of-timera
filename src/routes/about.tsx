          Timera exists for one reason: a beautiful watch should keep perfect time, survive real life,
          and still feel like a luxury object on your wrist — without a luxury price tag.

        <p className="mt-8 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          Every Timera runs on a precision <strong className="text-foreground">quartz movement</strong>.
          We are not a Swiss house and we never claim to be. Quartz is a deliberate choice: it is more
          accurate than a mechanical calibre, needs almost no servicing, handles heat and travel, and
          keeps our prices honest. What we do obsess over is the part you actually touch — case finishing,
          dial printing, strap quality, crystal clarity and the weight in your hand.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          Each piece is inspected by hand before it is boxed, ships with a warranty card, and is backed by
          a team you can reach on WhatsApp the same day.

            A quartz calibre drifts by seconds a month, not minutes a week. That means your Timera is right
            when you glance at it in a meeting, at a wedding, or at the airport — no winding, no setting, no
            expensive service every few years. We pair that movement with stainless steel cases, hardened
            crystal and straps chosen to age well, then check every unit before it leaves us.
